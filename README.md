# Angelic Audio

A simple Java GUI program using Swing to play some of my favorite songs.

I wrote this after learning about Swing and FileInputStream, I wanted to embedd my passion of music into the logic of programming.
As a beginner, I thought it was quite clever, so I decided to use switch statements to keep track of the playlist order. Now I think it's confusing and don't feel like changing it, but may eventually.
From this small project, I learned the importance of planning out the structure of a program beforehand, as I boxed myself in every corner of the way.

How to run and use
The program is operated through buttons that the user may click on with the mouse, it's quite simple.
This program is ran like any other java program, via terminal or command prompt with the 'java GUI.java' command in the appropriate directory.

I hope you enjoy at least one of these songs!
